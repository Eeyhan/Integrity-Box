## Why I Built This Module

*I noticed a lot of people either selling leaked keyboxes or paying for modules that claim to pass strong Play Integrity but only offer leaked keyboxes. I created this module to give you **real**, **working keyboxes** completely **free**, no hidden charges, no scams, just **legit access** along with several useful features. ðŸš«ðŸ”‘*


## Module Features

> **This module offers the following features:**  

-  Updates valid `keybox.xml`  
-  Updates `target.txt` as per your TEE status
-  Re-freshes target list on every reboot for seamless exprience
-  Switch Shamiko & Nohello modes (via module toggle)
-  Switch NoHello modes (via module toggle)
-  Guides users if their module setup is incorrect to pass play integrity
-  Adds all custom ROM detection packages in the **SusFS path**  
-  Disables EU injector by default  
-  Disables GMS ROM spoofing for  various cROMs 
-  Spoofs encryption status   
-  Spoofs ROM release key  
-  Spoofs SE Linux status
-  Updates PIF Fingerprint
-  Spoofs PIF Injection Values
-  Spoofs Tricky Store's Security Patch
-  Switches between AOSP & Valid keybox
-  FIXES Device not certified error
-  Shows banned keybox list
-  Set's verified boot hash via SusFs
-  Detects abnormal activity to help debug issues
-  More feature are there, check [WebUI](https://github.com/MeowDump/Integrity-Box/raw/main/DUMP/10.png)



## Pre-Requirements

> Please make sure you have the following **modules installed** before using this:

- [**Play Integrity Fork**](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/releases)
- [**Tricky Store**](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases)
> Make sure to properly hide root & zygisk traces, otherwise you won't be able to pass play integrity verdicts


## Need help?

NOTE: Use Action/WebUI button to report bugs/issues

- Hide root properly if play integrity isn't passing for you. If you are using a custom rom, make sure you have disabled inbuilt gms spoofing. How to disable it? Well it depends on what rom you're using. Join your rom help group & ask `how to disable it` there.  
- Avoid conflicting or unnecessary modules that expose your root environment

## Frequently Asked Questions

> Is Meow Assistant a malware?

### App Signing & Security Clarification

In earlier versions, the app was signed using a **test key**, which caused some security detectors to flag it as a potentially harmful app.

Starting from **Module v3+**, the app is now signed with a **private release key**.  
ðŸ”’ Although there were **no changes in functionality**, switching to a proper key has resolved the issue, there are **no more false detections** reported.  
**MEOW ASSISTANT IS NOW DEPRECIATED!**
