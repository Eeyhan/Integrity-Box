## ⚠️ **[DEPRECATED]**
### No More Obfuscation

There was a time when I had to implement obfuscation, mainly because some users were extracting the keybox directly from the source URL.

However, the PDF below explains how the obfuscation mechanism used to work. I’ve kept it in the repository as a small piece of history, a reminder of the journey this module has taken.
